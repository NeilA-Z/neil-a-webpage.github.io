                        In college, I pursued Electrical Engineering Technology, which, if you’re not familiar, sits somewhere between being a trade electrician and an engineer. As the saying goes, it’s the more budget-friendly alternative to engineering. However, my curiosity for technology didn’t begin in college—it started much earlier. I vividly remember spending time at the TV service center where my father worked, surrounded by exposed picture tubes and circuits. That experience completely reshaped the way I view the world.

                        In my spare time, I often find myself contemplating the untapped potential of technology, much like how television once revolutionized entertainment by solving the problem of boredom. Currently, I’m diving into the motor controller UMC100, paired with a VFD, with the goal of remotely controlling them via a webpage.

                        I've recently played around with an ABB PLC AC500 and booting it up was not as easy as expected due to packages and instrunctions on how to update the unit may not be up to date online. The provided schematic diagrams as well as the rest of the documentations were also not very easy to decipher for a beginner, I'm thinking this is largely to protect the PLC for any cyber threats but this also
                        increases the dependency of the users to the manufaturers. I hope they find other ways to prevent cyber threats while increasing user productivity an independence. I'm hoping this wouldn't be a similar case with my target project of UMC100. Let's see how it works!
